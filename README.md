# Coding Practice

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises, algorithms, and problem-solving practice focused on strengthening core programming fundamentals and preparing for technical interviews and real-world software development.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

* Improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Practice data structures and algorithms
* Write clean, readable, and efficient code
* Build consistency through regular coding practice
* Maintain a public record of learning and progress

## Contents

The repository may include (but is not limited to):

* Data Structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
* Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming)
* Mathematical and logical problems
* Language-specific practice
* Small coding exercises and experiments

## Structure

The code is organized into folders based on topic, problem type, or language.
Each solution typically includes:

* A clear problem statement (as comments or documentation)
* One or more implementations
* Notes on approach, complexity, or edge cases when relevant

## How to Use

* Browse folders by topic or language
* Review solutions and explanations
* Run or modify the code locally to experiment
* Use the problems as practice or reference material

## Notes

* Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness
* Some problems may have multiple approaches
* This repository is continuously updated as part of ongoing learning

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and practice purposes.
Problem statements may be adapted from common interview-style or publicly available sources.
