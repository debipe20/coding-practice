# Coding Practice

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises, algorithms, and problem-solving practice focused on strengthening core programming fundamentals and preparing for technical interviews and real-world software development.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

* Improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Practice data structures and algorithms
* Write clean, readable, and efficient code
* Build consistency through regular coding practice
* Maintain a public record of learning and progress

## Contents

The repository may include (but is not limited to):

* Data Structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
* Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming)
* Mathematical and logical problems
* Language-specific practice
* Small coding exercises and experiments

## Structure

The code is organized into folders based on company name, position name, problem type, or language.
Each solution typically includes:

* A clear problem statement (as comments or documentation)
* One or more implementations
* Notes on approach, complexity, or edge cases when relevant

## How to Use

* Browse folders by company name and role 
* Review solutions and explanations (if available)
* Run or modify the code locally to experiment
* Use the problems as practice or reference material

## Notes

* Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness
* Some problems may have multiple approaches
* This repository is continuously updated as part of ongoing learning

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and practice purposes only.
Problem statements may be adapted from common interview-style questions or publicly available sources.

Solutions are provided for learning and reference. Please review and validate them independently before use. The repository owner is not responsible for any incorrect or incomplete solutions.
